SUMMARY
-------

penger.db is a simplified system of budget analyzing.
There are no any needs to add transaction by transaction manually.
All produced payments are imported from the banks.
Main point is to automate processing of adding payments or incomes and also provide some usefull statistics, tools and graphs to analyze it.

In future realeses budget suggestions will be applied.

WHY IT IS USEFUL FOR ME
-----------------------

1. I have accounts in few banks. And few accounts in each bank.
2. Banks store transactions for 5 or more years. It is huge list of payments and it would be hard to add it manually to any budget analyzers.
3. But the banks provide an ability to download transactions in CSV. It is good news because it is possible to import all transactions to this system by one scope using special scripts.
4. After importing all transactions for many years it is not bad idea to run some tools to see stats, similar payments, balance, dynamic, charges, incomes etc.
5. These tools can produce some graphs to help to understand it.
6. Also there is a simplified clusterization of transactions. It means some of them are grouped by special keys and it is possible to see graphs or stats for payments by types or groups.
